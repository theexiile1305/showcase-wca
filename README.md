# Welcome to the Showcase of the Web Cryptography API
In the course of my bachelor thesis 'Evaluation and Implementation of a secure cloud storage with the Web Cryptography API' this application was implemented to show some basic cryptographic operations in web applications. This case study is a proof-of-concept to securely store, exchange and sign documents in the public cloud. Furthermore, all entities of the user- and identities management are encrypted on a client-side basis, enabling full end-to-end encryption.


## Installation steps
You can either use the production build on the [Website](https://img.shields.io/website?url=https%3A%2F%2Fshowcase-wca.web.app%2F) or the [docker image](https://github.com/theexiile1305/showcase-wca/packages/71505).
